      <h2>My Personal Favorites and Opinions</h2>
      <div class="ranking">
        <div class="rank-item">
          <span class="rank-number">1</span>
          <div>
            <h3>Ramen</h3>
            <p>As a noodle, its already among my top ranks! Beyond that, the texture and thinness of the noodles are simply perfect. Additional ingredients 
              like meat and egg add another layer of deliciousness and the depth of flavour only increases with the broth. It tastes and looks amazing, and will always 
              be a go-to dish for cold and indecisive days!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="rank-item">
          <span class="rank-number">2</span>
          <div>
            <h3>Sushi</h3>
            <p>How can something so delicious exist? The ingredients are so simple but have so much flavour and freshness! Alone they taste amazing and with soy sauce - even 
              more amazing! The salmon ones are exceptionally superb! If only I had the skill...I would be making them every week.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="rank-item">
          <span class="rank-number">3</span>
          <div>
            <h3>Unagi</h3>
            <p>I've only had a taste of it but it's already among my top 5 - this should be enough to make you go and try it. The eel is incredibly soft and tender but the slight crisp exterior 
            just wraps it all up. The first bite will definitely make you go in for more - the balance between taste and texture really stands out in this dish.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="rank-item">
          <span class="rank-number">4</span>
          <div>
            <h3>Takoyaki</h3>
            <p>Although not mentioned on this page, these ball-shaped dumplings are definitely worth trying! The typical octopus filling is delicious but I would love to try other variations. They 
            are a bit too filling to my liking as they can't be eaten as a light snack - but the flavour always makes up for it! They always turn out very hot inside, so you should be careful not to burn 
            your tongue - as a piece of advice, don't eat them in one bite!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="rank-item">
          <span class="rank-number">5</span>
          <div>
            <h3>Karaage/Japanese Fried Chicken</h3>
            <p>Fried chicken can never go wrong and karaage is proof of that. The crunch is good, the taste is good, but maybe the oil is not too good. It's the lowest ranked simply because of the oil and,
            sometimes, fried chicken is too simple. It's easy to eat when there's nothing you particularly crave for and as a simple snack, but it doesn't have a lot of variety.</p>
